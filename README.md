# Alarm

### I made an alarm that goes off at random times.
-----------------------------------------------------

Me and my girlfriend were trying to find a random date idea, we found one. We were going to switch places while making two different Legos. So I programmed this one to make us switch places at random times between 1-5 mins.


How does this work?
--------------------

```
git clone https://github.com/Xinacris/alarmBot.git
```

> py alarm.py

Voila!
